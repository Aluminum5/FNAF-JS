# FNAF-JS
The first FNAF game in JavaScript/HTML

Pretty much finished, just needs method of auth.

Will use NW.js for distribution as executable for Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as Greenworks for DRM to verify the user owns FNAF on Steam. Alternatively, a PHP script.

Includes used:
  - JQuery
  - NW.js
  - Greenworks
  - JQuery timer
  - WebP converter
  - SeamlessLoop.js
  - Script loader by chrysls

# How to run
