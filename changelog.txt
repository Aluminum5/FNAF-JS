Twenty-second Commit:

	- Fixed stopAmbientSound() not working/crashing the game on debug mode

	- Probably some other stuff I forgot.

Twenty-first Commit:
	- Added room names to map
	- Added sound for light switch not working
	- Added JS error alert catcher for testers to report errors without needing console up
	- Tweaked night 1 difficulty
	- Added WebP converter to /bin/
	- Added SeamlessLoop.js for fixing the ambient track loops

Twentieth Commit:
	- Added a changelog
	- Fixed "feedopen=true" bug, caused camerafeed to not open when foxxy appeared.
	- Added difficulty settings for nights 1-6
	- Updated sound engine:
		- Sounds are all preloaded for faster playback
		- Individual sounds can only be played one at a time (so no two of the same sound at the same time)
		- Hopefully this fixes sounds not playing back when game is run server-side.
		- Needs work on the functions; pauseSound() for example, to make it future-proof.
	- Added intro picture
	- Fixed highlighting bug.
	- Fixed new game not resetting to night 1.
	- Not an addition but a note; use %s, %i, %f inside console.log to show string, integer and float, respectively.
		- Example: flopper = "hello"; console.log("%s, my name is Sam",flopper);
		- Output is "hello, my name is Sam" in console.
		- Not sure if this is quicker  than console.log(flopper + ", my name is Sam") though.
	- Some other additions I might have forgotten.
